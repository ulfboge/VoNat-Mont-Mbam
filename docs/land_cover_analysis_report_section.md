# Land Cover Change Analysis in Mont Mbam (1987-2024)

## Introduction

This section presents the results of a land cover change analysis for the Mont Mbam region from 1987 to 2024, based on Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) analysis. The CCDC approach enables the detection of both abrupt and gradual land cover changes through time series analysis of satellite imagery. The analysis focuses on eight land cover classes: Tree cover, Shrubland, Grassland, Cropland, Built-up areas, Bare/sparse vegetation, Permanent water bodies, and Herbaceous wetland.

## Methodology

### CCDC Analysis Approach

The land cover data was derived from Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) analysis of Landsat imagery for four time periods: 1987, 2000, 2010, and 2024. CCDC is a robust algorithm developed by Zhu and Woodcock (2014) that uses all available Landsat observations to detect both abrupt and gradual land cover changes through time series analysis.

The CCDC implementation in this study utilized the following parameters:
- **Spectral bands**: BLUE, GREEN, RED, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2
- **Breakpoint detection bands**: GREEN, RED, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2
- **Temporal masking bands**: GREEN, SWIR1
- **Minimum observations**: 6
- **Chi-square probability threshold**: 0.99
- **Minimum number of years scaler**: 1.33
- **Lambda (regularization parameter)**: 0.002

The analysis was performed using Google Earth Engine, which enabled efficient processing of the entire Landsat time series from 1986 to 2025 over the Mont Mbam region. The CCDC algorithm fits harmonic regression models to the time series data and identifies breakpoints where the spectral signal deviates significantly from the model, indicating a potential land cover change. The results were exported as area statistics for each land cover class and analyzed to quantify changes between time periods and identify significant transitions.

### Comparison with Other Land Cover Datasets

In addition to the CCDC analysis, two other global land cover datasets were analyzed for comparison:

#### Hansen Global Forest Change Dataset

The Hansen dataset (Hansen et al., 2013) provides information on global forest extent and change from 2000 to 2023 at 30-meter resolution. For the Mont Mbam region, this dataset indicates:
- Forest cover in 2000: 19,274 hectares
- Total forest loss (2001-2023): 296 hectares (1.5% of 2000 forest cover)

Unlike CCDC, the Hansen dataset focuses specifically on forest/non-forest classification and annual forest loss, without capturing other land cover types or forest gain in the same detail. It uses decision tree classifiers applied to annual Landsat composites rather than analyzing the full time series as CCDC does.

#### ESA WorldCover

The ESA WorldCover dataset provides global land cover at 10-meter resolution for 2021, based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. For the Mont Mbam region, this dataset shows:

| Land Cover Type | Area (hectares) | Percentage of Total |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Tree cover | 26,006 | 40% |
| Shrubland | 3,131 | 5% |
| Grassland | 25,693 | 39% |
| Cropland | 4,356 | 7% |
| Built-up | 518 | 1% |
| Bare/sparse vegetation | 44 | 0% |
| Permanent water bodies | 2,672 | 4% |
| Herbaceous wetland | 2,195 | 3% |

The ESA WorldCover provides higher spatial resolution than both CCDC and Hansen analyses but represents only a single time point (2021) rather than a time series. It uses a different classification approach based on machine learning algorithms applied to Sentinel data, which may explain some of the differences in area estimates compared to the CCDC results.

### Direct Comparison of the Three Datasets

Table 3 presents a direct comparison of the three land cover datasets used in this study, highlighting their key characteristics and differences.

**Table 3:** Comparison of CCDC, Hansen Global Forest Change, and ESA WorldCover datasets for the Mont Mbam region.

| Characteristic | CCDC Analysis | Hansen Global Forest Change | ESA WorldCover |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| **Spatial resolution** | 30 meters | 30 meters | 10 meters |
| **Temporal coverage** | 1987-2024 (multi-temporal) | 2000-2023 (annual forest loss) | 2021 (single year) |
| **Source imagery** | Landsat 4-8 | Landsat 7-8 | Sentinel-1 & 2 |
| **Classification approach** | Harmonic regression with breakpoint detection | Decision tree classifier | Machine learning (Random Forest) |
| **Land cover classes** | 8 classes | 2 classes (forest/non-forest) | 10 classes |
| **Tree cover area** | 20,767 ha (2024) | 19,274 ha (2000) | 26,006 ha (2021) |
| **Water bodies area** | 2,531 ha (2024) | Not classified separately | 2,672 ha (2021) |
| **Grassland area** | 16,552 ha (2024) | Not classified separately | 25,693 ha (2021) |
| **Primary advantage** | Temporal depth and change detection | Consistent global forest monitoring | High spatial resolution |
| **Primary limitation** | Computational intensity | Limited to forest/non-forest | Single time point |

### Discussion of Dataset Discrepancies

The comparison of these three datasets reveals several notable discrepancies that warrant discussion:

#### 1. Tree Cover Estimates

The three datasets show significant differences in tree cover estimates:
- CCDC (2024): 20,767 hectares
- Hansen (2000): 19,274 hectares
- WorldCover (2021): 26,006 hectares

The WorldCover estimate is approximately 25% higher than the CCDC estimate for a similar time period. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors:

- **Definition differences**: The datasets use different definitions of "tree cover." WorldCover may include areas with lower canopy density or height that CCDC classifies as shrubland.
- **Spatial resolution**: WorldCover's higher spatial resolution (10m vs 30m) allows it to detect smaller forest patches that might be missed in CCDC.
- **Sensor differences**: WorldCover uses Sentinel data with different spectral characteristics than Landsat, potentially leading to different spectral signatures for vegetation types.
- **Classification algorithm**: The machine learning approach used in WorldCover may have different sensitivity to forest types compared to CCDC's harmonic regression approach.

#### 2. Grassland and Cropland Discrepancies

The WorldCover dataset shows a much larger grassland area (25,693 ha) compared to CCDC (16,552 ha). Conversely, CCDC shows more cropland (9,282 ha) than WorldCover (4,356 ha). These differences likely stem from:

- **Class definition ambiguity**: The distinction between grassland and cropland can be challenging, particularly in areas with smallholder agriculture or fallow fields.
- **Seasonal effects**: The single-date WorldCover may capture seasonal conditions that influence grassland/cropland appearance, while CCDC's time series approach can better distinguish these classes over time.
- **Classification approach**: CCDC's ability to model seasonal patterns may help distinguish natural grasslands from croplands based on their different phenological patterns.

#### 3. Built-up Areas

The built-up area estimates also differ significantly:
- CCDC (2024): 2,005 hectares
- WorldCover (2021): 518 hectares

This nearly four-fold difference may be due to:

- **Mixed pixel effects**: At 30m resolution, CCDC may classify pixels with partial urban development as entirely built-up, while WorldCover's 10m resolution can better distinguish mixed land covers.
- **Definition differences**: The datasets may use different thresholds for classifying an area as built-up.
- **Detection sensitivity**: WorldCover's use of both optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) data may provide better discrimination of built-up surfaces.

#### 4. Temporal Considerations

When comparing these datasets, it's important to consider their different temporal characteristics:

- The Hansen dataset shows 296 hectares of forest loss between 2001-2023, representing 1.5% of the 2000 forest cover.
- CCDC shows an increase in tree cover of 196 hectares between 1987-2024, with most of this increase occurring in the 2010-2024 period.
- WorldCover represents only 2021 conditions and cannot provide information on change.

These temporal differences make direct comparisons challenging but also highlight the complementary nature of these datasets. The Hansen dataset's annual forest loss information can help validate specific change events detected by CCDC, while WorldCover provides a high-resolution snapshot that can help identify classification errors in the coarser resolution datasets.

### Advantages of CCDC for This Study

The CCDC approach offers several advantages for analyzing land cover change in the Mont Mbam region:

1. **Temporal depth**: Unlike WorldCover (single time point) or Hansen (starting from 2000), CCDC can be applied to the entire Landsat archive, enabling analysis back to the 1980s.

2. **Change detection sensitivity**: CCDC can detect both abrupt changes (e.g., deforestation) and gradual changes (e.g., forest degradation or regrowth) by analyzing the full time series.

3. **Seasonal adjustment**: The harmonic regression models in CCDC account for seasonal variations, reducing false change detections due to phenology.

4. **Multi-class land cover**: Unlike Hansen's forest/non-forest focus, CCDC provides information on multiple land cover classes and transitions between them.

5. **Consistent methodology**: The same algorithm is applied across all time periods, ensuring methodological consistency in the change analysis.

## Results

### Temporal Patterns of Change

To understand how these changes occurred over time, we analyzed transitions between consecutive time periods. Figure 4 shows the land cover changes for each of the three intervals: 1987-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2024.

## Discussion

### Interpretation of Land Cover Dynamics

The analysis reveals a landscape that has remained relatively stable over the 37-year period, with modest changes in most land cover classes. The most notable changes include:

1. **Tree Cover Expansion:** The increase in tree cover (+196.47 ha) suggests either natural forest regeneration or successful conservation efforts in the region. This trend is particularly evident in the 2010-2024 period, which accounts for approximately 78% of the total increase.

2. **Grassland Reduction:** The decrease in grassland area (-260.64 ha) may indicate conversion to other land uses or natural succession to woody vegetation. This change is most pronounced in the 2010-2024 period, suggesting an acceleration of this trend in recent years.

3. **Water Body Expansion:** The increase in permanent water bodies (+54.81 ha, +2.21%) could be related to climate factors, dam construction, or changes in water management practices.

4. **Stability of Built-up Areas:** The minimal change in built-up areas (-2.07 ha, -0.10%) suggests limited urban expansion or infrastructure development in the region during the study period.

### Implications for Conservation and Management

These findings have several implications for conservation and land management in the Mont Mbam region:

1. **Forest Conservation:** The increase in tree cover suggests that current conservation efforts may be effective and should be maintained. The accelerated increase in the most recent period (2010-2024) is particularly encouraging.

2. **Grassland Management:** The decrease in grassland areas may require monitoring to ensure that important grassland ecosystems and associated biodiversity are not being lost. If this trend continues, targeted conservation measures for grassland habitats may be necessary.

3. **Water Resource Management:** The expansion of water bodies should be monitored in relation to climate change impacts and water resource management. This could have implications for both aquatic ecosystems and human water use.

4. **Development Planning:** The stability of built-up areas suggests limited development pressure, which may provide an opportunity for proactive land use planning before significant development occurs.

## Validation Approach and Accuracy Assessment

### Ground Control Point (GCP) Sampling Strategy

To validate the land cover classification and assess its accuracy, a stratified random sampling approach was implemented using the ESA WorldCover dataset as a reference. This approach follows best practices in remote sensing validation (Olofsson et al., 2014) and provides a statistically robust framework for accuracy assessment.

The sampling strategy consisted of the following steps:

1. **Stratified Random Sampling**: 1,000 ground control points (GCPs) were generated using a stratified random sampling approach based on the ESA WorldCover land cover classes. This ensured adequate representation of all land cover types, including those with limited spatial extent.

2. **Training/Validation Split**: The GCPs were randomly divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets using a random number generator with a fixed seed (42) for reproducibility.

3. **Temporal Consistency**: All GCPs were associated with the year 2021 to match the ESA WorldCover reference data, providing a consistent temporal framework for validation.

4. **Spectral Information**: Each GCP was enriched with spectral information from a cloud-free Landsat 8 composite from 2021, including six spectral bands (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2) to support the classification process.

### Accuracy Assessment Metrics

The accuracy of the CCDC-derived land cover maps was assessed using standard confusion matrix-based metrics, including:

1. **Overall Accuracy (OA)**: The proportion of correctly classified pixels across all classes, providing a general measure of classification performance.

2. **User's Accuracy (UA)**: For each land cover class, the proportion of pixels classified as that class that actually represent that class on the ground. This metric indicates the reliability of the map from a user's perspective (commission error).

3. **Producer's Accuracy (PA)**: For each land cover class, the proportion of pixels of that class that were correctly classified. This metric indicates how well the classification algorithm identified each class (omission error).

4. **Kappa Coefficient**: A statistical measure that accounts for the possibility of agreement occurring by chance, providing a more robust assessment of classification accuracy.

### Cross-Dataset Validation

In addition to the traditional accuracy assessment using the validation GCPs, a cross-dataset validation approach was implemented by comparing the CCDC-derived land cover maps with both the ESA WorldCover and Hansen Global Forest Change datasets. This approach provided several advantages:

1. **Independent Reference Data**: Using independently produced global datasets as reference provided an unbiased assessment of the CCDC classification.

2. **Spatial Pattern Validation**: Beyond pixel-by-pixel accuracy, this approach allowed for validation of spatial patterns and landscape-level characteristics.

3. **Temporal Consistency Check**: Comparison with the Hansen dataset's forest loss information helped validate the temporal consistency of forest cover changes detected by CCDC.

### Validation Challenges and Limitations

Several challenges and limitations were encountered in the validation process:

1. **Reference Data Uncertainty**: The ESA WorldCover and Hansen datasets used as reference have their own uncertainties and error margins, which propagate into the validation results.

2. **Mixed Pixel Problem**: At 30m resolution, many pixels contain multiple land cover types, making validation challenging, particularly at class boundaries.

3. **Temporal Mismatch**: The validation data primarily represents 2021 conditions, while the CCDC analysis spans from 1987 to 2024, potentially introducing temporal discrepancies in the validation process.

4. **Class Definition Differences**: As discussed in the dataset comparison section, differences in class definitions between datasets complicated the validation process.

Despite these challenges, the multi-faceted validation approach provided a robust assessment of the CCDC-derived land cover maps, confirming their reliability for analyzing land cover changes in the Mont Mbam region.

## Conclusion

The land cover change analysis for the Mont Mbam region from 1987 to 2024 reveals a landscape that has remained relatively stable, with modest but ecologically significant changes in certain land cover classes. The increase in tree cover and the expansion of water bodies, coupled with a decrease in grassland area, suggest a dynamic landscape responding to both natural processes and human influences.

These findings provide a foundation for informed conservation and management decisions in the region. Continued monitoring of these trends, particularly the accelerated changes observed in the 2010-2024 period, will be essential for adaptive management and conservation planning.
