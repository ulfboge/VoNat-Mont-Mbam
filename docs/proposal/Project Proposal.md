## Project Overview

This project aims to support Voice of Nature (VoNat) in its mission to protect biodiversity and promote sustainable development in the Mont Mbam region of Cameroon. The primary goal is to produce accurate land cover maps and complementary environmental data to facilitate informed conservation decisions.

### Project Objectives:

- Generate a detailed, up-to-date land cover map for Mont Mbam.  
- Assess forest loss using global datasets.  
- Analyze historical fire frequency in the area.  
- Identify additional relevant environmental factors contributing to conservation planning.

## Deliverables

### 1\. Land Cover Map (Main Priority)

- Land cover classification using ESA WorldCover (10m) or Copernicus Global Land Service (100m).  
- High-resolution map tailored to the Mont Mbam area of interest (AOI), as defined by [Momo Solefack et al. (2018)](https://revuecangeotrop.ca/volume-8-numero-2/8799/).  
- Delivered in digital formats (GeoTIFF, PDF, JPEG) suitable for reports and presentations.

### 2\. Forest Loss Analysis

- Analysis of forest loss based on Hansen Global Forest Change dataset (2000-2024).  
- Identification of recent deforestation hotspots.

### 3\. Fire Frequency Analysis

- Historical analysis of fire frequency (2001-2024) using MODIS burned area data.  
- Mapping of high and low fire frequency zones within the AOI.

### 4\. Additional Environmental Information (Suggested)

- Digital Elevation Model (DEM) analysis (SRTM/Aster).  
- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to assess vegetation health.  
- Infrastructure and accessibility analysis (roads, settlements).

## Proposed Timeline

| Task | Completion Date |
| :---- | :---- |
| Project Initiation & Data Review | 20 March 2025 |
| Initial Land Cover Mapping | 28 March 2025 |
| Land Cover Change Map Delivery (Draft) | 31 March 2025 |
| Forest Loss Analysis | 10 April 2025 |
| Fire Frequency Analysis | 20 April 2025 |
| Additional Environmental Layers | 30 April 2025 |
| Final Report and All Outputs | 10 May 2025 |

## Data & Resources Required from VoNat

- GPS point data from Mount Mbam area (already provided).  
- Any additional spatial data or local knowledge on specific areas of concern or interest.  
- Feedback on draft deliverables to ensure relevance and accuracy.

## Communication & Reporting

VoNat will receive regular updates throughout the project. Feedback loops are planned after the draft delivery of each primary output to incorporate any necessary adjustments promptly.

## Repository for Data & Outputs

A dedicated GitHub repository will be created to store and manage project files, outputs, scripts, and documentation for transparency, reproducibility, and ease of access.
