# Reports Directory

This directory contains the final reports for the Mont Mbam Land Cover Analysis project. These reports document the methodology, results, and findings of the comprehensive geospatial analysis conducted for the Mont Mbam region.

## Main Reports

### Central Area CCDC Report

**Filename:** `Central_Area_CCDC_Report.md`

This is the primary output of the project, focusing on the central survey area (18,054 hectares) of Mont Mbam. The report presents a detailed analysis of:

1. Land cover composition and changes from 1987 to 2024
2. Forest loss patterns based on Hansen Global Forest Change data (2001-2024)
3. Fire disturbance trends using MODIS burned area data (2000-2024)
4. Survey-calibrated land cover classification for 2024

Key findings include:
- Remarkable landscape stability over the 37-year study period (96.9% persistence)
- Modest tree cover expansion (+196.47 ha) and grassland reduction (-260.64 ha)
- Dramatic decline in fire occurrence from ~9,503 ha/year (2000-2009) to ~1,091 ha/year (2017-2024)
- Recent acceleration in forest loss with 2023-2024 accounting for nearly 25% of all forest loss in the 24-year record

### Land Cover Change Analysis Report

**Filename:** `Land_Cover_Change_Analysis_Report.md`

This report provides a broader analysis of land cover changes across the entire Mont Mbam region. It complements the Central Area CCDC Report by providing context for the changes observed in the central survey area.

## Figures

All figures referenced in these reports are stored in the `../figures/` directory. See the README in that directory for a complete list of figures and their descriptions.

## Report Generation

These reports were generated through a collaborative process involving:

1. Analysis of remote sensing data using Google Earth Engine and Python
2. Integration of field survey data (287 points) for improved classification accuracy
3. Visualization of results using matplotlib and GEE
4. Technical writing focused on remote sensing and GIS methodologies

The reports are formatted in Markdown for easy viewing on GitHub and can be converted to PDF or other formats as needed.
