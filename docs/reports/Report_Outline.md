## 3. Results (Iterative Deliverables)
### 3.1 Field Survey Coverage
#### 3.1.1 GPS Point Distribution Map
**Title:** "Ecological Features and Land Use Patterns: VoNat Field Survey Points in Mont Mbam"

**Description:** This map displays the spatial distribution of 268 GPS points documenting key ecological features and land use patterns in the Mont Mbam region. The points capture various landscape elements including burnt areas, riparian forests, water sources, and settlements, providing insights into current land use practices and environmental conditions.

#### 3.1.2 Field Survey Findings Summary
- **Land Use Patterns:**
  - Prevalence of burnt areas for grazing
  - Distribution of herder settlements
  - Extent of degraded areas

- **Ecological Features:**
  - Riparian forest distribution
  - Water source locations
  - Wildlife observations (e.g., monkey sightings)

- **Environmental Pressures:**
  - Areas affected by bush burning
  - Degraded landscapes
  - Human-wildlife interaction zones

- **Conservation Implications:**
  - Critical habitat areas
  - Water resource management
  - Grazing pressure zones

### 3.2 Land Cover Analysis
#### 3.2.1 Land Cover Classification Map
**Title:** "Land Cover Distribution in Mont Mbam Region: Current Landscape Patterns"

**Description:** This map presents the current land cover classification of the Mont Mbam region, highlighting the distribution of major land cover types including forests, grasslands, and human-modified areas. The classification provides a baseline understanding of the landscape composition and helps identify areas of natural vegetation, agricultural activities, and human settlements.

- Current land cover distribution
- Land cover change patterns
- Habitat fragmentation assessment

### 3.3 Forest Status Assessment
#### 3.3.1 Forest Cover Baseline Map
**Title:** "Forest Canopy Cover in Mont Mbam Region (2000): Tree Canopy Closure Analysis"

**Description:** This map illustrates the forest canopy cover distribution in the Mont Mbam region for the year 2000, derived from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset. The data represents tree canopy closure for all vegetation taller than 5 meters in height, providing a baseline understanding of the region's forest structure. This baseline map serves as a crucial reference point for assessing subsequent forest changes and degradation patterns.
