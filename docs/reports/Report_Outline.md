### 3.2 Land Cover Analysis
#### 3.2.1 Land Cover Classification Map
**Title:** "Land Cover Distribution in Mont Mbam Region: Current Landscape Patterns"

**Description:** This map presents the current land cover classification of the Mont Mbam region, highlighting the distribution of major land cover types including forests, grasslands, and human-modified areas. The classification provides a baseline understanding of the landscape composition and helps identify areas of natural vegetation, agricultural activities, and human settlements.

### 3.3 Forest Status Assessment
#### 3.3.1 Forest Cover Baseline Map
**Title:** "Forest Canopy Cover in Mont Mbam Region (2000): Tree Canopy Closure Analysis"

**Description:** This map illustrates the forest canopy cover distribution in the Mont Mbam region for the year 2000, derived from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset. The data represents tree canopy closure for all vegetation taller than 5 meters in height, providing a baseline understanding of the region's forest structure. This baseline map serves as a crucial reference point for assessing subsequent forest changes and degradation patterns.
