# Mont Mbam Report - Updated Sections (May 14, 2025)

This document contains the sections of the Land Cover Change Analysis Report that were updated on May 14, 2025 to incorporate the survey area analysis and survey-calibrated CCDC maps.

## Executive Summary Updates

### Original First Paragraph:
```
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of land cover dynamics in the Mont Mbam region between 1987 and 2024. Using multiple remote sensing datasets and analytical approaches, we have documented remarkable landscape stability over the 37-year study period, with 96.9% of the area maintaining the same land cover type. The most significant changes occurred in the 2010-2024 period, including modest tree cover expansion, grassland reduction, and water body expansion. These changes coincided with a dramatic decline in fire occurrence from an average of ~9,503 hectares burned annually in 2000-2009 to only ~1,091 hectares annually in 2017-2024.

### Original Second Paragraph:
```
Our analysis reveals a complex interplay between fire regimes and vegetation dynamics, with 48% of grassland areas experiencing at least one fire event during the study period, compared to much lower percentages in forested areas. Additionally, 62% of all transitions from tree cover to grassland occurred in areas that experienced at least two fire events. Despite the overall landscape stability, the Hansen dataset identified 296 hectares of forest loss between 2001-2023, with the highest loss recorded in 2023 (45.7 ha).

### Updated Second Paragraph:
```
Our analysis reveals a complex interplay between fire regimes and vegetation dynamics, with 48% of grassland areas experiencing at least one fire event during the study period, compared to much lower percentages in forested areas. Additionally, 62% of all transitions from tree cover to grassland occurred in areas that experienced at least two fire events. A focused analysis of the central survey area (18,054 hectares) confirms these regional patterns while providing more detailed insights into localized changes. Despite the overall landscape stability, the Hansen dataset identified 296 hectares of forest loss between 2001-2023 across the region, with the highest annual loss recorded in 2023 (45.7 ha), a pattern also observed in the survey area.
```

### Original Third Paragraph:
```
Based on these findings, we recommend a balanced ecosystem management approach that recognizes the ecological value of both forest and grassland ecosystems, strategic fire management planning, continued monitoring of recent forest loss and hydrological changes, and maintaining methodological consistency in future assessments. This report establishes a crucial baseline for understanding landscape dynamics in the Mont Mbam region and provides a foundation for future conservation and management efforts.

### Updated Third Paragraph:
```
Based on these findings, we recommend a balanced ecosystem management approach that recognizes the ecological value of both forest and grassland ecosystems, strategic fire management planning, continued monitoring of recent forest loss and hydrological changes, and maintaining methodological consistency in future assessments. The development of survey-calibrated CCDC land cover maps using local field data has significantly improved classification accuracy and provides a more reliable foundation for monitoring future changes. This report establishes a crucial baseline for understanding landscape dynamics in the Mont Mbam region and provides a foundation for future conservation and management efforts.

## Discussion Section Updates

### Original Data Limitations Point:
```
- **Data Limitations**: Different methodologies between datasets (CCDC, Hansen Global Forest Change, and ESA WorldCover) result in varying estimates of land cover areas. For example, tree cover estimates range from 19,274 ha (Hansen, 2000) to 26,006 ha (ESA WorldCover, 2021). These differences reflect methodological variations rather than actual changes and highlight the importance of consistent methodologies when assessing land cover change.

### Updated Data Limitations Point and New Multi-scale Analysis Point:
```
- **Data Limitations and Improvements**: Different methodologies between datasets (CCDC, Hansen Global Forest Change, and ESA WorldCover) result in varying estimates of land cover areas. For example, tree cover estimates range from 19,274 ha (Hansen, 2000) to 26,006 ha (ESA WorldCover, 2021). These differences reflect methodological variations rather than actual changes and highlight the importance of consistent methodologies when assessing land cover change. The development of survey-calibrated CCDC maps using 268 field survey points has significantly improved classification accuracy by incorporating local ground-truth data, providing a more reliable foundation for future monitoring.

- **Multi-scale Analysis**: The focused analysis of the central survey area (18,054 hectares) confirms the broader regional patterns while providing more detailed insights into localized changes. The survey area shows a higher proportion of grassland (49.7% vs. 39%) and tree cover (42.2% vs. 40%) compared to the broader region, but exhibits similar forest loss patterns (1.4% loss over 23 years compared to 1.5% regionally). This multi-scale approach enhances our understanding of landscape dynamics and helps identify areas requiring targeted conservation efforts.

## Conclusions Section Updates

### Original Project Achievements:
```
**Project Achievements**: This study has successfully established a comprehensive baseline of land cover dynamics in the Mont Mbam region using multiple datasets and analytical approaches. The integration of CCDC analysis, Hansen Global Forest Change data, and ESA WorldCover has provided complementary perspectives on landscape change. Additionally, the fire disturbance analysis has revealed important temporal trends and spatial patterns that help explain some of the observed land cover dynamics. The field survey with 268 GPS points has documented current ecological features and land use patterns, providing ground-based context for the remote sensing analyses.

## New Figure Caption for Land Cover Change Map

```
**Figure 25: Land Cover Change in Mont Mbam (1987-2024)**  
*This map highlights areas that experienced land cover change between 1987 and 2024 based on the survey-calibrated CCDC classification. Changed areas (shown in pink) represent only 3.1% of the total landscape, confirming the remarkable stability of the Mont Mbam region over the 37-year study period. The distribution reveals that changes are not randomly distributed but follow specific patterns, with the northeastern portion showing fewer changes, suggesting greater landscape stability in this area. The black outline delineates the study area boundary, with the large water body visible in the southwest corner providing a geographic reference point. This analysis demonstrates that despite some localized transitions, particularly visible in the central and southern portions, the overall landscape composition has remained largely unchanged over nearly four decades.*

## Map Title and Description for QGIS

### Title:
```
Mont Mbam Land Cover (1987-2024): Survey-Calibrated CCDC Classification
```

### Description:
```
Land cover classification of the Mont Mbam region based on Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) analysis of Landsat imagery (1987-2024), calibrated with 268 local field survey points. This map shows eight land cover classes (Tree cover, Shrubland, Grassland, Cropland, Built-up, Bare/sparse vegetation, Water bodies, and Wetland), providing improved local accuracy over global datasets. The classification captures both abrupt and gradual changes across the study period, revealing modest tree cover expansion (+196 ha) and grassland reduction (-260 ha), with most changes occurring after 2010 coinciding with declining fire activity in the region.
