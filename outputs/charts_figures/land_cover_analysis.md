| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Forest Cover in 2000 | 19,274 ha |
| Total Forest Loss (2001-2023) | 296 ha |
| Percentage Loss | 1.5% |

### Annual Forest Loss Trends
| Year | Forest Loss (ha) |
|------|------------------|
| 2001 | 7.8 |
| 2002 | 6.7 |
| 2003 | 9.6 |
| 2004 | 11.8 |
| 2005 | 13.4 |
| 2006 | 26.3 |
| 2007 | 9.5 |
| 2008 | 1.7 |
| 2009 | 15.1 |
| 2010 | 10.3 |
| 2011 | 0.8 |
| 2012 | 11.4 |
| 2013 | 9.8 |
| 2014 | 9.6 |
| 2015 | 7.2 |
| 2016 | 4.4 |
| 2017 | 11.5 |
| 2018 | 18.4 |
| 2019 | 9.6 |
| 2020 | 13.1 |
| 2021 | 20.8 |
| 2022 | 18.7 |
| 2023 | 45.7 |

### Key Findings:
- The study area had 19,274 hectares of forest cover in 2000
- Over 23 years (2001-2023), 296 hectares of forest were lost
- The annual forest loss rate is relatively low at 1.5% over the entire period
- Notable peaks in forest loss occurred in:
  - 2006 (26.3 ha)
  - 2009 (15.1 ha)
  - 2018 (18.4 ha)
  - 2021 (20.8 ha)
  - 2023 (45.7 ha)
- The lowest forest loss was recorded in 2011 (0.8 ha)

### Note on Data Sources:
The 2000 forest cover data is derived from the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset, while the 2021 tree cover data comes from ESA WorldCover. These datasets use different methodologies, definitions, and spatial resolutions for forest/tree cover classification. The apparent increase in tree cover between 2000 (19,274 ha) and 2021 (26,006 ha) should be interpreted with caution as it likely reflects differences in classification methods rather than actual forest growth.

## 3. Conservation Implications

1. **Forest Cover Status**:
   - The relatively low forest loss rate (1.5% over 23 years) suggests effective conservation measures
   - The presence of 19,274 hectares of forest in 2000 indicates significant conservation value
   - The forest loss of 296 hectares over 23 years represents a relatively small proportion of the total forest area

2. **Land Use Patterns**:
   - The balance between tree cover (40%) and grassland (39%) suggests a diverse ecological landscape
   - The moderate cropland extent (7%) indicates sustainable agricultural development
   - Water-related features (7% combined) highlight the importance of aquatic ecosystems
   - Limited built-up areas (1%) show minimal urban encroachment

3. **Conservation Priorities**:
   - Focus on maintaining the current forest cover, especially given the increased loss in recent years (45.7 ha in 2023)
   - Monitor and manage the increasing trend in forest loss observed in 2021-2023
   - Consider the ecological value of both forest and grassland ecosystems
   - Protect water bodies and wetlands as important ecological components

## 4. Recommendations

1. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Implement regular forest cover monitoring with special attention to areas showing recent loss trends
   - Develop early warning systems for forest loss, particularly targeting areas with similar characteristics to those lost in 2021-2023
   - Strengthen protection measures in areas with high forest loss rates (especially the 45.7 ha lost in 2023)
   - Establish a monitoring protocol for the 19,000+ hectares of remaining forest

2. **Sustainable Land Use**:
   - Promote sustainable agricultural practices within the 4,356 hectares of cropland
   - Develop guidelines for grassland management across the 25,693 hectares of grassland
   - Maintain the current balance between tree cover and grassland ecosystems
   - Implement watershed protection measures for the 4,867 hectares of water bodies and wetlands

3. **Conservation Strategies**:
   - Consider establishing protected areas for critical forest patches, prioritizing areas with intact forest
   - Develop community-based forest management programs to address the increasing forest loss trend
   - Implement reforestation initiatives in degraded areas, with a target to offset the 296 hectares lost since 2001
   - Create ecological corridors connecting forest patches to maintain ecosystem connectivity
