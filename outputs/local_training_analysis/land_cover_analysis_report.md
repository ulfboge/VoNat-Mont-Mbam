# Mont Mbam Land Cover Change Analysis (1987-2024)
## Based on Local Training Data

*Generated on 2025-05-14*

## Overview
This analysis examines land cover changes in the Mont Mbam region from 1987 to 2024 using CCDC (Continuous Change Detection and Classification) analysis results based on local training data.

## Key Findings

### Land Cover Distribution
The total study area is approximately 65597.85 hectares.

| Land Cover Type | 1987 Area (ha) | 2024 Area (ha) | Change (ha) | Change (%) |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Tree cover | 21109.95 | 21322.44 | 212.49 | 1.01 |
| Permanent water bodies | 2852.28 | 2997.90 | 145.62 | 5.11 |
| Built-up | 1027.53 | 1072.26 | 44.73 | 4.35 |
| Bare / sparse vegetation | 21.69 | 27.36 | 5.67 | 26.14 |
| Shrubland | 3265.02 | 3270.24 | 5.22 | 0.16 |
| Cropland | 8903.25 | 8905.41 | 2.16 | 0.02 |
| Herbaceous wetland | 3335.76 | 3198.60 | -137.16 | -4.11 |
| Grassland | 25082.37 | 24803.64 | -278.73 | -1.11 |

### Land Cover Stability
- 97.60% of the study area maintained the same land cover class from 1987 to 2024.

### Major Land Cover Transitions
The following are the most significant land cover transitions observed:

| From | To | Area (ha) |
|------|------|----------|
| Grassland | Tree cover | 203.40 |
| Herbaceous wetland | Permanent water bodies | 199.78 |
| Permanent water bodies | Herbaceous wetland | 55.50 |
| Grassland | Built-up | 51.85 |
| Grassland | Cropland | 46.16 |
| Cropland | Built-up | 40.91 |
| Tree cover | Grassland | 23.92 |
| Built-up | Grassland | 23.74 |
| Built-up | Tree cover | 21.34 |
| Tree cover | Cropland | 18.68 |

## Conclusion

Tree cover has increased by 212.49 hectares (1.01%) from 1987 to 2024. Grassland has decreased by 278.73 hectares (1.11%). Built-up areas have increased by 44.73 hectares (4.35%).

Water bodies have increased by 145.62 hectares, while wetlands have decreased by 137.16 hectares.

Overall, the landscape shows a relatively high degree of stability, with 97.60% of the area maintaining the same land cover class over the 37-year period. The most dynamic transitions appear to be between grassland and tree cover, suggesting natural succession processes or changes in land management practices.
