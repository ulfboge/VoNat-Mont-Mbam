## Key Findings
- **Highest Agreement**: Tree cover shows the highest agreement between field observations and CCDC classification.
- **Lowest Agreement**: Shrubland shows the highest commission error, indicating potential classification challenges.
- 6 points classified as Tree cover by CCDC were observed as Bare / sparse vegetation in the field.
- 7 points classified as Shrubland by CCDC were observed as Tree cover in the field.
- 51 points classified as Grassland by CCDC were observed as Bare / sparse vegetation in the field.
- 12 points classified as Cropland by CCDC were observed as Built-up in the field.
- 6 points classified as Built-up by CCDC were observed as Tree cover in the field.
- 3 points classified as Bare / sparse vegetation by CCDC were observed as Tree cover in the field.
